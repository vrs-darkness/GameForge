# GameForge

GameForge is an AI-powered tool designed for newbie developers, enabling them to create command-line interface (CLI) games through modular programming. The application guides users by generating checkpoints where they need to build specific functions, making the learning process interactive and engaging.

## Features

- **AI-Assisted Learning:** Query the LLM to generate checkpoints that challenge users to build functions, enhancing their programming skills.
- **Modular Programming Approach:** Encourages best practices in software development by breaking down tasks into manageable modules.
- **Secure API:** Implements JWT authentication to ensure a safe environment for users.
- **Task Management:** Utilizes Celery and Redis for efficient message queuing, ensuring smooth operation of background tasks.
- **Minimalistic UI:** Built with React, providing an intuitive user experience for learners.

## Installation

Installation instructions for both the backend and frontend can be found in their respective folders.

## Inspiration

GameForge was inspired by the growing need for accessible and engaging programming education in an increasingly digital world. As a developer, I recognized that many aspiring programmers face challenges when transitioning from theoretical knowledge to practical application. I wanted to create a tool that not only demystifies the process of coding but also encourages creativity and experimentation. By integrating AI-driven checkpoints into the learning experience, GameForge empowers users to take charge of their learning journey, transforming complex programming tasks into manageable, interactive challenges. 

- üåü **Empowerment:** Encourages users to experiment and explore their coding potential.  
- üí° **Engagement:** Turns learning into an interactive experience through gamification.  
- ü§ù **Community Building:** Fosters collaboration and sharing among budding developers.  

## Advantages

GameForge offers numerous advantages for aspiring developers seeking to enhance their coding skills. The interactive learning approach allows users to practice their programming abilities in a hands-on manner, which is often more effective than traditional learning methods. The structured checkpoints guide users through the development process, helping them focus on specific tasks and gradually build their confidence and expertise. 

- üöÄ **Hands-On Experience:** Provides practical challenges that enhance skill acquisition.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Modular Programming:** Promotes best practices essential for real-world software development.  
- üåç **Community Engagement:** Creates a platform for sharing experiences and learning from peers.  


## Future Improvements

- **Chat Interface:** A chat interface will be built soon to facilitate real-time interaction with the LLM, enhancing user experience and support.

## Contributing

To further enhance the user experience, the frontend interface will be improved soon, incorporating feedback from users and making it even more intuitive and visually appealing. By continually evolving GameForge, I aim to create a tool that not only meets the needs of budding developers but also inspires a lifelong passion for programming.
